# Recursion
Project from CSS 143 UWB course

This assignment consists of two parts, both dealing with recursion. In the first, I wrote a program that recursively searches a directory tree. In the second, I wrote a program that implements a binary search of a list of strings. Here are the descriptions of the two parts, along with any supporting files, if available:
